The Odin Project: PROJECT: ETCH-A-SKETCH

This project took me a bit longer than expected... Mainly because I learned so much while developing it!

At first i was struggling with the grid itself. With the help of Coding with Rob (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyhuaXeuyGo&t=755s&ab_channel=CodingWithRob) I was able to understand it.

Then, i started choosing which colors to add buttons...Black, white, green, yellow and so on.
I also added size of canvas for Small, Medium and Large, and a text input field to change the density of the canvas (rows x columns)
Each color and size had a button, which was making the code and the design bloated. 

So I looked at some options to add a color picker, instead of a button for each color. At first i added an RGB slider! I hadn't used it before, so it was good to learn how to use range input in HTML and how to manipulate it with JavaScript. I also changed the canvas size and pixel density to a range slider, which makes it more user friendly.

I was happy with the structure, when I learned about the 'color' input in HTML, which i also didn't use before! So i changed the RGB range slider to the Color input, which made the design cleaner and the java script code MUCH shorter, as i didn't need a variable and document selector for each input (R, G and B) anymore. 

Lastly, i went to add the Rainbow button. The function I also got from the help of Coding with Rob, but I decided to add it as a On/Off button. So with that I also learned the 'checkbox' input!

And finally, on to CSS! Which was another great challenge. How to change all the input buttons on CSS was something really new and confusing. But I think i started to get the hang of it.


This was a really fun project to develop, as I learned a lot with all the changes I decided to make. There's still some things that could be improved and added, like a 'Clear' button, grid on and off toggle, eraser button. But I'll revisit it in a later time for these improvements.
